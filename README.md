jQuery Practice Hands-On
Requirements
Add the following to the respective files. Don't forget to link your style.css, script.js, and add the jQuery CDN to your HTML page!

Step 1
index.html file:

A header that includes a page title and background color
A paragraph that says "Click here to learn more about jQuery!"
An unordered list of the following programming languages:
JavaScript, C#, Java, Ruby, Python
Two inputs: one for first name and last name
Make sure to label the inputs
Step 2
script.js file:

When the header is hovered over with the mouse, the font color should change and when the mouse stops hovering, it returns to the original color.
When the paragraph element is clicked on, it should populate the following paragraph: "jQuery is a fast, JavaScript library that makes many tasks easier and simpler to accomplish. A JavaScript library contains pre-written JavaScript which makes developing applications a bit easier for the developer. This means jQuery is not a language, but an extension of JavaScript. It takes many lines of JavaScript code, which we would have had to write ourselves before jQuery, and compresses it."
Hint! You will be using a new jQuery method: .text()

When a list element is double clicked on, it should be hidden from view
When typing in an input, on keydown, toggle the following class:
.input{
    color: red;
}
Step 3
style.css file:

Style your page so it has a bit of life!
